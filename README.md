# Story Behind the project:
I've been working as a Teacher for 7 years in both Senior High School and College levels. There were plenty of times in the past where I wished to have a single application that I can use wherein I can find everything within the app itself such as: a lesson planner, class schedule viewer, an active clock (for me to attend my classes on time), students' attendance, reminders & etc. So far, I haven't found any app that lessens the job of teachers and help them focus on studying their subjects to teach and classroom management skills instead of spending a lot of time working on their reports and other stuff using different technologies such as MS Word, Excel & etc. I also wish to have such an app a social network feature wherein Teachers and Students can connect over the network within the school and just discuss school matters in the app instead of using their personal social media networks, fb messengers online.

# SUPPORT
I'm still looking for fellow developers out there who are willing to contribute their skills for the success of the project. If you're a Teacher as well and is also looking to build an app that can help you lighten the responsibilities of your career as an Educator, please feel free to support this project by joining our project's discussion and project development.
